    Hash mode interface to the Keccak code package.

    The Keccak F1600 modules were downloaded from:   
        http://keccak.noekeon.org

    For the 64 bit reference version the following Keccak modules are used:

    KeccakHash.c
    KeccakHash.h
    displayIntermediateValues.c
    displayIntermediateValues.h
    KeccakF-1600-reference.c
    KeccakF-1600-reference.h
    KeccakF-1600-interface.h
    KeccakDuplex.c
    KeccakDuplex.h
    KeccakSponge.c
    KeccakSponge.h
    brg_endian.h
  
    For the 64 bit optimized version, the following Keccak modules are used:

    KeccakHash.c
    KeccakHash.h
    KeccakF-1600-opt64.c
    KeccakF-1600-interface.h
    KeccakF-1600-opt64-settings.h
    KeccakF-1600-64.macros
    KeccakF-1600-unrolling.macros
    KeccakDuplex.c
    KeccakDuplex.h
    KeccakSponge.c
    KeccakSponge.h
    brg_endian.h

    For the 32-bit reference version, replace:

        KeccakF-1600-reference.c with KeccakF-1600-reference32BI.c

    For the 32-bit optimized version, replace:

        KeccakF-1600-opt64.c with KeccakF-1600-inplace32BI.c

    For the 64-bit compact version, replace:

        KeccakF-1600-opt64.c with Keccak-compact64.c

    INSTALLATION:

    If intermediate values and the ability to change the number of
    rounds are not needed, Use the optimized versions. To make all
    four versions type:
  
        make
   
    This creates a bin directory and the files sha3sum64
    (optimized version), sha3sumr64 (reference version),
    sha3sum32 (optimized version using in place 32-bit interleaving),
    sha3sumr32 (reference version using 32-bit interleaving), and
    sha3sumc (compact 64-bit).

    To build individually type:

        make sha3sum64      (Optimized 64-bit)
            -or-
        make sha3sum32      (Optimized 32-bit)
            -or-
        make sha3sumr64     (Reference 64-bit)
            -or-
        make sha3sumr32     (Reference 32-bit)
            -or-
        make sha3sumc       (Compact 64-bit)

    To build just the optimized versions type:

        make optimized

    or for just the reference versions type:

        make reference
   
    For just the 64-bit versions type:
   
        make 64-bit
   
    and for just the 32-bit versions type:
   
        make 32-bit

    Rename your choice to sha3sum. (optional)

=======================================================================

    The original makefile that is distributed with the code package
    (named makefile-Keccak) is also included (but not needed here).
    To use the original makefile, nrRounds was declared in
    main.c so that the above modifications will not break any of the
    original code package builds if needed. Added line:

        unsigned int nrRounds = 24;

    at the beginning of program main.c.
